  An example sensor that reads the GPIO level defined in input-gpios. The
  purpose of this sensor is to demonstrate how to create out-of-tree drivers.

  Example definition in devicetree:

    examplesensor {
        compatible = "zephyr,examplesensor";
        input-gpios = <&gpio0 0 (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)>;
    };

compatible: "zephyr,examplesensor"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  input-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
